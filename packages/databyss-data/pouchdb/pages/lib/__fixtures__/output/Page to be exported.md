A short page with all of the possible hypertextual elements in Databyss.

[CERN: "Link to Living"](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/DesignIssues/LinkToLiving.html)
‚Å†The web never implemented [[t/Link to living]] universally. We might consider this for the collections architecture, though.

Is Databyss a "hyperindexing" system? ([[s/Bruza 1992]])

# [[t/Structured Documents]]

TBL addresses an early W3 debate about whether to standardize the structure of a hypertext document or not. I think what's interesting about Databyss is that it allows free-form documents but gives readers and authors some standard, built-in ways to understand and navigate the texts - it's not all left to the whims of the hyperlink author.

TBL also analyzed the benefits and challenges of what we call the automatic motif linking in r2c.  
He called it "generic linking", and in [another document](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Products/Microcosm/Microcosm.html) describes how [[t/Microcosm]] uses disambiguation menus for generic links like we do in r2c.

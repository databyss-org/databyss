                "Three years ago, I began reading the work of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida—commonly referred to as the father of deconstruction. I was so enamored with his writing, and felt like I was learning so much, that I wanted to make sure I took very good notes. So I began by annotating the insides of my books, appending page numbers and notes wherever I could find an empty space. As I continued reading, I started filling so many blank pages that I realized, with dismay, that it was going to be extremely hard for me to retrace my steps. How was I possibly going to remember which page it was that Derrida discussed Justice, Descartes, or the Trace?",
                "I decided to transcribe my notes onto a word-processor so that they would be searchable. One of the unique things about Derrida’s writing is that he will return to the same ideas in many of the texts he has written. For example, you often find him talking about Justice in a paper that isn’t specifically about Justice. I realized that if I wanted to understand what Derrida thinks about Justice, it would be quite helpful to organize my notes by concept or motif (rather than by source text). I opened up a .pages file and started creating these headings as I transcribed my notes. I ended up creating 841 motifs/concepts by the end of the process. As I transcribed my notes I would copy and paste each one into all the motifs that seemed relevant.",
                "I could not use Zotero or Mendeley for this type of organization because these applications place the organizing buckets, specifically the bibliographical material, in the central position. You can take notes in these apps, but notes remain encumbered within bibliographical buckets. And there is no way to read a series of notes one after the other, which was the main purpose of organizing the notes the way I did. I needed all the bibliographical information there, but I needed it hidden, so that I could streamline the process of note-taking and note-reading.",
                "When I finished reading over 100 texts by Derrida, I had written a 2500 single-spaced .pages document. I was able to search motifs/concepts by pressing open apple F, but this was very limiting. Additionally, sometimes I wanted to read the notes from a single text, but that was utterly impossible. My friend Paul solved these problems by developing the website returntocinder.com. He compiled my notes so that they could be organized by both motif and source text.",
                "Databyss combines the simple yet organized style of note-taking I developed with the rendering and search capacities of returntocinder.com. As I went through the process of organizing my notes, I discovered, by way of trial and error, many helpful shorthands and stylistic efficiencies that can help other researchers. Databyss hopes to make it easy for a user to apply all the information necessary to ensure that their notes can be traced down in various ways: by motif, by source, by page number, by phrase.",

One way to think about Databyss is that it functions as a searchable record of the margin notes you once left in your books. You can record quotations, link them to the source text, and include a formatted page or chapter location. Since Databyss also allows you to search topics as if they were files, you can keep dream books in Databyss, phone records, journal entries or any other kind of every-day record keeping. Since Databyss has the feel of a word-processor, you can also write your novels, romantic emails, or political rants here."

If you are trying to decide which to use, a good rule of thumb is to use Open Library or Google Books for books and Cross Ref to search for your journal article. (Often times, all three databases might carry the information you're looking for.) We should note that Google Books sets a limit on the number of searches allowed (1000) for websites using their API, and it may be out of service more often than not."

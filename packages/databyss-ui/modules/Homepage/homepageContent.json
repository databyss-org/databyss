              "Three years ago, I began reading and annotating the work of the philosopher Jacques Derrida—commonly referred to as the father of deconstruction. I started filling so many blank pages that I realized, with dismay, that it was going to be extremely hard for me or anyone else to retrace my steps and find my notes useful.",
              "I decided to transcribe my notes onto a word-processor so that they would be searchable. I soon (well, not *so* soon) had written a 2500 page (single-spaced!) document. I was able to search it by pressing COMMAND+F, but this was very limiting. So, I began looking for software that would allow for deeper, more meaningful searches.",
              "At the same time, I began adding more authors to my annotation project, so I now needed a precise bibliography for my notes. Apps like Zotero and Mendeley are great for this, and while they support notes, they force them into bibliographic buckets and are not the \"writing tool\" I was looking for. It seemed there was no suitable application, so I continued to use a word-processor in spite of its limitations.",
              "I shared these limitations with Paul, who had helped me build [returntocinder.com](https://returntocinder.com), a web version of my Derrida notes. After months of discussions, we conceived of *Databyss*, a simple word-processor application with powerful organization and search features. Even in its beta form, I already use *Databyss* for all my annotation projects, for my class notes, and for basic everyday lists. Paul and I hope you will find it equally versatile and useful for your own projects.",

                  "answer": "Databyss works extremely well to record notes of any genre of study or reflection. One way to think about Databyss is that it functions as a searchable record of the margin notes you once left in your books. You can record quotations, link them to the source text, and include a formatted page or chapter location. Since Databyss also allows you to search topics as if they were files, you can keep dream books in Databyss, phone records, journal entries or any other kind of every-day record keeping. Since Databyss has the feel of a word-processor, you can also write your novels, poems, or political rants here."

From time to time, you may see a spinning icon in the upper-right corner of the page. This indicates that Databyss is sending your changes to the server to be saved. In other words, you don't need to do anything to save your work. But, you should wait until this indicator disappears before closing the browser or navigating away from Databyss"

When you go back online, Databyss saves the pending changes to the cloud. Rest assured that we are hard at work creating a true \"offline mode\" for our next release."

When you do that, an option will appear to \"Copy link\" — click that, and the URL to share your page will be copied to your clipboard.

                      "Jake Reeder is an adjunct professor of philosophy at Marist College. He received his Ph.D. from Birkbeck College where we wrote a dissertation on the literary nature of Dr. Paul Schreber's *Memoirs of My Nervous Illness*, a famous text in the psychoanalytic canon. Since that time, he has read extensively in the fields of deconstruction, critical race theory, and gender studies. The multidisciplinary nature of his interests and the accumulation of way too many notes inspired Jake to spearhead the creation of new digital humanities projects, like the collection of annotations to be found at [returntocinder.com](https://returntocinder.com).",

                "Three years ago, I began reading and annotating the work of the philosopher Jacques Derrida—commonly referred to as the father of deconstruction. I started filling so many blank pages that I realized, with dismay, that it was going to be extremely hard for me or anyone else to retrace my steps and find my notes useful.",
                "I decided to transcribe my notes onto a word-processor so that they would be searchable. I soon (well, not *so* soon) had written a 2500 page (single-spaced!) document. I was able to search it by pressing COMMAND+F, but this was very limiting. So, I began looking for software that would allow for deeper, more meaningful searches.",
                "At the same time, I began adding more authors to my annotation project, so I now needed a precise bibliography for my notes. Apps like Zotero and Mendeley are great for this, and while they support notes, they force them into bibliographic buckets and are not the \"writing tool\" I was looking for. It seemed there was no suitable application, so I continued to use a word-processor in spite of its limitations.",
                "I shared these limitations with Paul, who had helped me build [returntocinder.com](https://returntocinder.com), a web version of my Derrida notes. After months of discussions, we conceived of *Databyss*, a simple word-processor application with powerful organization and search features. Even in its beta form, I already use *Databyss* for all my annotation projects, for my class notes, and for basic everyday lists. Paul and I hope you will find it equally versatile and useful for your own projects.",

                    "answer": "Databyss works extremely well to record notes of any genre of study or reflection. One way to think about Databyss is that it functions as a searchable record of the margin notes you once left in your books. You can record quotations, link them to the source text, and include a formatted page or chapter location. Since Databyss also allows you to search topics as if they were files, you can keep dream books in Databyss, phone records, journal entries or any other kind of every-day record keeping. Since Databyss has the feel of a word-processor, you can also write your novels, romantic emails, or political rants here."

                    "answer": "Cross Ref, Open Library and Google Books are unique databases that store the bibliographical material of 100,000s of books, journal articles, and more. If you are trying to decide which to use, a good rule of thumb is to use Open Library or Google Books for books and Cross Ref to search for your journal article. (Often times, all three databases might carry the information you're looking for.) We should note that Google Books sets a limit on the number of searches allowed (1000) for websites using their API, and it may be out of service more often than not."

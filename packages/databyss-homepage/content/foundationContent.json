Since its publication in 2017, it has become a popular resource for researchers of critical race theory, philosophy, and the digital humanities. It served as an inspiration and guide for building the Databyss application, which allows any researcher - even if they have no programming or web publishing expertise - to compile and edit digital humanities resources like Return to Cinder."

A student of deconstruction, the idea that the word itself is a technology inspired him to spearhead the two note-taking projects associated with the Databyss Foundation. Since words only survive through interaction, he continues to direct these projects, believing that accessibility and ‚Äúuser-friendliness‚Äù are essential to thinking and invention. A general lover of the word, he  writes both fiction and theory."

In addition to serving as Technical Director for the Databyss Foundation, Paul is a developer for the Barcelona node of the newly chartered European Media and Immersion Lab. A strong believer in open source and open standards in software, he contributes to the IEEE Spatial Web Working Group, trying to ensure that the next web is a just, accessible, and socially responsible environment for all."

        "In 2015, Dr. Jake Reeder began reading and annotating the work of the philosopher Jacques Derrida‚Äîcommonly referred to as the father of deconstruction. He started filling so many blank pages that he realized, with dismay, that it was going to be extremely hard for him or anyone else to retrace his steps and find his notes useful.",
        "He decided to transcribe his notes onto a word-processor so that they would be searchable. He soon (well, not _so_ soon) had written a 2500 page (single-spaced!) document. He was able to search it by pressing COMMAND+F, but this was very limiting. So, he began looking for software that would allow for deeper, more meaningful searches.",
        "At the same time, he began adding more authors to his annotation project, so he now needed a precise bibliography for his notes. Apps like Zotero and Mendeley are great for this, and while they support notes, they force them into bibliographic buckets and are not the \"writing tool\" he was looking for. It seemed there was no suitable application, so he continued to use a word-processor in spite of its limitations.",
        "He shared these limitations with Paul, who had helped build returntocinder.com, a web version of his Derrida notes. Together, they conceived of _Databyss_, a simple word-processor application with powerful organization and search features. Databyss was launched in the spring of 2020. Today, Dr. Reeder and many other researchers use _Databyss_ daily for their annotation projects, their class notes, assignments, articles, and more.",
        "To ensure the sustainability of the Databyss platform, and to foster the growth of the projects built on it, Paul and Jake formed the Databyss Foundation in 2021. With your support, it will maintain these tools and those to come, keeping them free and accessible to all, forever."
